In short, the main differences between quicksort and mergesort are:

**Partitioning vs. Merging:**
- Quicksort partitions the array based on a pivot element and recursively sorts the smaller subarrays. It involves dividing the array into smaller parts and sorting them individually.
- Mergesort divides the array into halves recursively until each subarray contains only one element, then merges the sorted subarrays together. It involves breaking down the array and merging the sorted parts.

**Worst-case Time Complexity:**
- Quicksort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) if not implemented carefully, such as when the pivot selection results in highly unbalanced partitions.
- Mergesort has a guaranteed worst-case time complexity of O(n*log(n)), as it consistently divides the array into halves and merges them in a balanced manner.

**Space Complexity:**
- Quicksort typically requires less additional memory compared to mergesort because it sorts the array in place, only requiring O(log(n)) additional space for recursion.
- Mergesort requires additional memory for merging the sorted subarrays, resulting in O(n) additional space complexity.

**Performance:**
- In general, Mergesort is more consistent and reliable in terms of performance because of its guaranteed O(n*log(n)) time complexity and stability (i.e., the relative order of equal elements is preserved).
- Quicksort can be more performant in practice for small to medium-sized arrays and on average, due to its in-place partitioning and fewer memory operations. However, its worst-case time complexity makes it less predictable.

In terms of performance, mergesort is often preferred for applications where stable sorting and guaranteed worst-case performance are important, or when the dataset is large and the available memory allows for the additional space complexity. Quicksort may be favored for its simplicity and potential performance benefits in certain scenarios, especially for small to medium-sized datasets. Ultimately, the choice between quicksort and mergesort depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the sorting task.
