## 2. Interview Process

The interviewer is interested in **your thought process** as much as the final code. Follow these steps:

1. **Clarify:**  
   Ask clarifying questions about the input, output, and constraints (e.g., integer size, maximum array length, null values).

2. **Outline:**  
   Verbally describe your proposed approach before writing any code.

3. **Example Walkthrough:**  
   Walk through a small, concrete example by hand to ensure your logic is sound.

4. **Code:**  
   Write clean, runnable code.

5. **Test:**  
   Verbally test your code with simple, typical, and edge-case inputs.
